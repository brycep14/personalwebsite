                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I'm a student currently in BYU's Advertising Program with a knack for creativity and new ideas.</p>
                <p>I love bringing artistic and interesting ideas to life and adding my own personal touch to the world around me.</p>

                <h3>I freaking love...</h3>
                <p>...all sorts of things.</p>
                <p>Currently, some of the things I freaking love the most are basketball and art</p>
                <p>My urge to create art has turned into a joke among our friends after a trip to thrift store ended in a old painting that we refurbished mosaic-style using paint samples acquired from Home Depot.</p>
                <p>Balling up with friends is a must every Thursday, and don't get me started on the Oklahoma City Thunder. (Gosh I love this years team)</p>

                <p>...all sorts of adventures. From epic car rides to Yellowstone or Arches, to abandoned mineshafts filled with grafitti, or just a trip downtown
                I'm always down for any and every kind of adventure, especially late night drives to cool places with music bumping in the background</p>

                <h3>Speaking of music...</h3>
                <p>...as the picture proves I'm basically an a-list celebrity at this point</p>
                <p>I dabble in a few instruments and have performed the guitar in places as prestigious as my Grandma's background, a patio fireplace, and a church talent show. Superbowl Halftime Show, here I come.</p>
                <p>I tend to have an earbud in any chance I can get away with it, and if you listen closely you can hear me belting it out to songs in the car and the shower. Horribly off-key unfortunately, but such is life. I'll listen to just about anything and everything so throw your music suggestions at me.</p>

                <h3>One of my biggest inspirations...</h3>
                <p>...for all my creative endeavors is Casey Niestat. The first time I watched this video, Do What You Can't, I was captivated and fell in love with his creativity, content style, and the way he always put his personal touch on his videos, belongings and world around him.</p>
